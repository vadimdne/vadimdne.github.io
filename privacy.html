      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Data Security</h2>
      <p>Some Apps developed by the Developer, including but not limited to <strong>"Aurora: AI Psychic Readings"</strong> and <strong>"Correct me: AI writing helper"</strong>, allow a user to input data via the app or the keyboard extension.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">The user input data (including the input through the keyboard extension) is used solely for the Appâ€™s functional purpose (e.g. text editing or grammar checking). The Apps are designed to not log, store, or retain any of the data you input. Once the text processing is completed, any data temporarily held in App memory is discarded.</p>
      <p class="mt-4">The user input data may be transmitted directly to third-party service APIs (such as OpenAI's API) over a secure HTTPS connection. The Developer has no access to this data, as the transmission happens directly from the client device to the API. Such transmissions are made in real-time. No records of the original text and/or the corrections are kept.</p>
